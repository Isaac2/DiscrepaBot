# DiscrepaBot

This is a bot I made for the /r/mexico subreddit to summarize long articles into 3 concise paragraphs, it uses the awesome SMMRY API to create the excerpts.

### Software Requirements

- Python 3.6+ (install the praw and redis libraries with pip3)
- Redis

I run the script every 15 minutes with crond, feel free to fork and create your own bot.
